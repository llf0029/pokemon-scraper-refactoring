# pokemon-scraper-refactoring
Scraper app to be refactored. Original scraper by whiteha91.

The application has undergone 3 iterations of refactoring, resolving the 3 of
the worst "code smells".

See the file, PokemonScraper-CodeSmells.txt, in the root directory for detailed 
documentation of the refactoring process.
This file includes an identification of the worst code smells, along with a
step-by-step report of how they were managed, and finally an evaluation of each
refactoring iteration.

Test coverage reports for each refactoring iteration can be found within the
TestCoverage directory. These reports were generated by the python package,
"coverage", using the --branch flag, and show that the tests that were written
never cover less than 80% of the code affected by refactoring during the
iteration.
